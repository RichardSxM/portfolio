            This was the first high school I attended to for 2 years. Here I basically learned a little bit of everything then I left and went on to Milton Peters College.

        <h1 class="bold chapter">Aqua Mania Adventures</h1>
        <p>
           Aqua Mania was my first ever job in life and I learned so much there. I helped so many people from different parts of the world, with watersports and also on boat trips. I've become a stronger swimmer and an even stronger athlete with the world I had to do there.
