        <p class="edit">
            Richard was born on the beautiful island of Sint Maarten on April 4th, 1997 around 12 - 1 AM. He was a healthy kid other than him growing up with an abnormal heart. His parents go by name of 'Bernadette Thomas' and 'Elmon F. Minette'. He had a twin sister named Rachelle and an older sister named Erna. Richard also has 3 brothers. Richard's situation at home wasn't really difficult, that's how his mom made it seem. Growing up, he didn't get everything he wanted, but he was always blessed with what his mother provided. Starting at 2 years old, his mother brought him to her homeland, Dominica, every other year until he was the age of 12. At the age of 8 years old, Richard lost his older sister in a car crash when she was 21 years old. Nevertheless, he stayed strong, never gave up on trying and continued to live and face every challenge in life. Richard attended primary school at Sister Marie Laurence, a Catholic Dutch school in his neighborhood. Growing up, he stayed out of trouble and always listened to his mother.

            Richard graduated from primary school and attended the secondary school, Sundail, for 2 years. During that period, he did not get Dutch classes due to the fact that the teacher left. Because of this, Richard's Dutch language wasn't up to part like it should've been. He transferred schools and continued secondary school at Milton Peters College, at PKL level. He followed the stream 'Electro en Techniek' for 2 years. As Richard grew older, he realized that this wasn't enough for himself and wanted more. At the age of 16, he graduated from PKL and climbed higher, attending VMBO. At first, he was told that he couldn't make it because of his Dutch language being so poor. Richard still pushed and lived by his mother words: "nothing beats a trier". He continued his high school period in the stream 'Techniek' and did very well. He graduated and proved everyone wrong who doubted him.

            After graduating, Richard was offered a job by Aqua Mania Adventures, a watersport company. There, he worked for 2 years. Within those 2 years, he went to lots of parties and went clubbbing with his friends very frequently. He lived life like it was his last. At a point, Richard knew that this wasn't the end for him. He then applied to Landstede MBO in the Netherlands, in the city of Zwolle. He got accepted around the same time his twin-sister died. With nothing keeping him back, Richard still managed to be strong and leave Sint Maarten, moving on with his life and taking on the challenge to achieve all his goals.
